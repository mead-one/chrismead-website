    <h2>Software Developer and Student based in Stoke-on-Trent</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my personal corner of the web! I'm currently in the placement year section of my Bachelor's degree in AI &amp; Robotics. During my studies I've gained hands-on experience with everything from machine learning techniques, to natural language processing, to embedded systems programming, to project management and group work.</p>
    <p>Outside campus, I've contributed to several paid software projects, including a part time placement with <a href="https://sensormagic.co.uk/">Sensor Magic</a>, where I've honed my software engineering and problem solving skills and learned to create efficient and reliable solutions.

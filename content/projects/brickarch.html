<section id="intro">
    <p>While working at <em>H.G. Matthews</em>, a brickyard in Southeast England, I was tasked with solving the problem of the lengthy and time-consuming nature of creating accurate templates for use in the manufacturing of brick arches, which at the time were calculated and drawn manually in pencil. I developed a bespoke software solution capable of not only creating the requested templates, but also generating accurate, labelled technical drawings for providing customers a preview of exactly what they were paying for.</p>
    <p>On this page, I have created a rudimentary demonstration of this functionality. This was, in part, to explore the possibility of developing a standalone web app for generating these templates and drawings, with options to export them to industry standard electronic formats. Some of the features I have in mind far surpass even the capabilities of the original CAD program, including custom keystones and advanced shapes with multiple curves. Development of this demonstration is still ongoing - check <a href="#todo">the to-do list</a> to view and track my progress.</p>

    <h1>To-do List</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>(Most important) Fix the broken maths on flat arches with rises</li>
        <li>Implement horizontal joints for radial arches</li>
        <li>Implement complex horizontal joints for flat-gauge arches with options for curves</li>
        <li>(Long-term) Implement custom arch shapes with configurable bends (like thick strokes from paths with joints and curves in Inkscape)</li>
        <li><strike>Implement vertical joints</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Implement basic shapes for all arch types</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Figure out more sensible scaling algorithm for axes' labels and grid</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Change expand/restore functionality to maximise/restore for all project windows</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Replace toolbar spans with class system for displaying required items</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Move window bar to program itself and change section font/styling</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Refactor existing JavaScript with emphasis on object-oriented practices</strike></li>
    </ul>

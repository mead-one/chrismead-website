<p>While working at H.G. Matthews, a brickyard in Southeast England, I was tasked with solving the lengthy process of creating architectural drawings of brick arches for use in previews for customers and templates printed on plastic sheets for use in the manufacturing of brick arches. On this page, I have created a rudimentary demonstration of this functionality, and some of the planned features surpass even the capabilities of the original CAD program - check <a href="#todo">the to-do list</a> to see and track my progress.</p>

    <h1>To-do List</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>(Most important) Fix the broken maths on flat arches with rises</li>
        <li>Implement horizontal joints for radial arches</li>
        <li>Implement complex horizontal joints for flat-gauge arches with options for curves</li>
        <li>(Long-term) Implement custom arch shapes with configurable bends (like thick strokes from paths with joints and curves in Inkscape)</li>
        <li><strike>Implement vertical joints</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Implement basic shapes for all arch types</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Figure out more sensible scaling algorithm for axes' labels and grid</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Change expand/restore functionality to maximise/restore for all project windows</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Replace toolbar spans with class system for displaying required items</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Move window bar to program itself and change section font/styling</strike></li>
        <li><strike>Refactor existing JavaScript with emphasis on object-oriented practices</strike></li>
    </ul>

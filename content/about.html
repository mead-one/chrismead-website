<h2>Software Developer and AI &amp; Robotics Student Based in Stoke-on-Trent</h2>
<p>My name is Christopher Mead, or "Chris" for short.

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I'm an undergraduate student of <em>AI &amp; Robotics</em>, going into my final year. This bachelor's degree has provided me with hands-on experience building autonomous robots, training machine learning models, and programming microcontrollers in C. It has also fleshed out my technical foundation, which now includes a firm grasp of the fundamentals of both machine learning and classical AI techniques.</p>
<p>The programme has included a sandwich placement with <em>AiDenVi Ltd.</em>, in which I worked alongside a talented team of my peers to design and develop an AI-powered web application, using machine learning to deliver technical files for electronic components. During my studies I've gained hands-on experience with everything from natural computer vision and language processing, to embedded systems programming, to project management and group work.</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>As a mature student who didn't return to education until my late twenties, my passion for computing and software development predates my formal university education by over a decade. I was able to develop and grow independently of a set curriculum, and chose to immerse myself in the world of administrating GNU/Linux-based systems, free and open source software and software development in my spare time for over a decade before deciding to return to higher education, culminating in my <a href="/projects/brickarch">first paid project as a self-taught software developer</a>.</p>
<p>The early stages of my self-taught education in programming were spent poring over books such as <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> by Zed Shaw and <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> by Marijn Haverbeke (and I still own a copy of <em>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>, which I <em>will</em> find the time to work through one of these days).
<p>My love and passion for free and open source software has continued to grow, leading to my daily use of GNU/Linux on my personal devices, and <a href=https://neovim.io>NeoVim</a> being my editor of choice, with an extensively customised configuration in <a href="https://lua.org">Lua</a>.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>I'm available for summer opportunities until I start my final year of university in October 2025, as well as for any other opportunities that may arise. I encourage you to reach out to me via the links in the footer of this page, or check out my <a href="/projects">projects section</a>, or <a href="/blog/">blog</a> to explore more of my work, learnings and interests.</p>

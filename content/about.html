<h2>Software Developer and Student Based in Stoke-on-Trent</h2>
<p>My name is Christopher Mead, or "Chris" for short. I'm currently in the sandwich year portion of my Bachelor's degree in <em>AI &amp; Robotics</em>, working at <a href="https://aidenvi.com">AiDenVi</a> on a web application, using machine learning to generate technical files for electronic components. During my studies I've gained hands-on experience with everything from machine learning techniques, to natural language processing, to embedded systems programming, to project management and group work.</p>
<p>My passion for computing and software development predates my formal university education - I immersed myself in the world of GNU/Linux, free and open source software and software development in my spare time for over a decade before deciding to return to higher education, culminating in my <a href="/projects/brickarch">first paid project as a self-taught software developer</a>.</p>
<p>This website was generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a static site generator, using <a href="https://vitejs.dev">Vite</a>, to compile the TypeScript code for my project demos. The source files are available on [Github](https://github.com/mead-one/chrismead-website).</p>

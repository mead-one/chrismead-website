## Software Developer and Student Based in Stoke-on-Trent
My name is Christopher Mead, or "Chris" for short. I'm currently in the sandwich year portion of my Bachelor's degree in _AI &amp; Robotics_, working at [AiDenVi](https://aidenvi.com) on a web application, using machine learning to generate technical files for electronic components. During my studies I've gained hands-on experience with everything from machine learning techniques, to natural language processing, to embedded systems programming, to project management and group work.

My passion for computing and software development predates my formal university education - I immersed myself in the world of GNU/Linux, free and open source software and software development in my spare time for over a decade before deciding to return to higher education, culminating in my [first paid project as a self-taught software developer](/projects/brickarch).

This website was generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator, using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), to compile the TypeScript code for my project demos. The source files are available on [Github](https://github.com/mead-one/chrismead-website).
